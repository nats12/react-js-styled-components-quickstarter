# React Styled Components Quickstarter

Do you often use create-react-app combined with styled-components for your React web apps? 

[**nod here**] 

Cool, me too! And I find that I tend to set up my projects using the same structure over and over again. So why not clone a repo that's already structured in this way! 

## Structure
After installing a fresh copy of create-react-app, I did the following:

1. Installed styled-components and added some theme files:
-- `colours.js`
-- `devices.js`
-- `sizes.js` (used in devices)
-- `index.js` (for exporting our theme)
2. Wrapped our app in a `ThemeProvider` using the above theme.
3. Added some global styles.
4. Created a __\__tests____ directory for all tests.


That's it! 

I find working with this structure super useful. And who doesn't love saving a few minutes of repo setup? ðŸ˜Ž

Enjoy!
